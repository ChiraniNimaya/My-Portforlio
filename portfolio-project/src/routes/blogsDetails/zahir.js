  content: [
    `Reading *The Zahir* by Paulo Coelho was not just a book experience for me — it felt like an inner
     conversation I had been avoiding for a long time. It’s a story about a man searching for his missing wife,
     but for me, it became a mirror reflecting how we chase after things that consume us.`,
    `Coelho’s exploration of obsession versus freedom resonated deeply. I realized how easily our thoughts can
     become fixated on what we’ve lost — and how that fixation becomes “the Zahir,” taking over our minds.
     The protagonist’s journey toward acceptance and spiritual freedom reminded me that love isn’t about
     possession — it’s about growth and release.`,
    `I remember finishing the last few chapters feeling strangely calm. It felt as if Coelho had put into words
     the silent chaos of attachment and self-discovery. It’s a book I’d recommend to anyone trying to understand
     their own patterns of holding on — and letting go.`
